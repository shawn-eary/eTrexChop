Command-line Utility to Trim Track Points out of an eTrex 30x GPX File

Does not support offsets right now.  May crash in MS Windows but seems to work in GNU\Linux.  

I will fix the issues eventually, but I will personally be using this tool when I don't have "easy" access to Garmin Basecamp
and I just want to trim some points from the front and (eventually back) of an eTrex GPX file.

Problem is I sometimes have to start my eTrex before I start my event, so I have non-relvent data at the front of the GPX file.  Also, there is often a delay from when I end my event upto when I can turn the eTrex off so there is also non-relevent
data at the end of the file. 

This simple "hack" (when finished) will allow me to do that without using Garmin Basecamp.  Part of the reason I wrote this
"hack" is because, there is no Garmin Basecamp for GNU\Linux that I'm aware of.

Yes, I can edit the GPX files via EMACS, but this is easier for me.
